# An attempt at functional programming in Typescript

The goal of this app was to try and solve a challenge using Typescript, while not  
not mutating any data.  

It was quite challenging when dealing with iterative functions, something where a  
for loop would have been nice, instead recurrsion was used. The "app" doesn't have  
a command line interface to it, simply adjust the variables when calling the cashRegister  
function.

## Installation

1. Clone the repo.
2. $ yarn install
3. A - $ node . (executes the index.js file)
3. b - $ yarn dev (runs typescript live compile and nodemon which executes the  
index.js on change)
